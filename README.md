# Weather-Data-Analysis
This project undertakes a comprehensive exploration of historical weather data to discover the intricate relationships among meteorological variables. Addressing key questions, the analysis reveals that temperature variations are particularly influenced by precipitation type, with rain exhibiting the most significant temperature ranges. The correlation analysis discovered a strong negative correlation between humidity and temperature indicating temperature decreases as humidity rises. Humidity levels and temperature emerged as significant factors, impacting visibility. Surprisingly, wind speed showed a negligible linear relationship with temperature (based on the data available). Lastly, the regression analysis revealed that significant predictors of temperature include humidity, wind speed, visibility and precipitation types (rain and snow).
